I want to build a Telegram bot that can stream large Telegram media files (especially movies) directly in VLC without requiring full download.
Write exact code, folder structure, dependencies, and setup steps.
Use Python + Pyrogram or Telethon.
The bot should:

Fetch a file from a Telegram chat/channel by file_id or message link.

Generate a public or local streaming URL that VLC can open using “Open Network Stream”.

Stream the file in chunks without loading it entirely into RAM.

Support resume/seek using HTTP Range headers.

Handle large files (2GB+).

Work on a cheap VPS or local machine.

Include a working FastAPI/Flask server that pipes Telegram file chunks to VLC.

Provide a /start and /stream command in Telegram.

Explain how to avoid bandwidth bottlenecks, timeouts, and Pyrogram session limits.

Show how to deploy and keep the bot running (systemd or PM2).

Finally, test everything with a sample Telegram video file and show the exact VLC URL to stream it.
